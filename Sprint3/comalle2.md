# Sprint 3
My name is Conor O'Malley. My Github ID is comalle. The prject that I am working with is called MeowTillery.

# Planned to do
* I was assigned to issue 48: [Issue 48](https://github.com/Jazny/MeowTillery/issues/48 "Issue 48")
* This issue was essentially a hotbar for ease of access to players instead of opening the inventory every time.
* Adding an ambient Human AI.  [Issue 35](https://github.com/Jazny/MeowTillery/issues/35 "Issue 35")
* Finsihing Inventory with a working hotbar, equipment slots, and picking things up. [Issue 45](https://github.com/Jazny/MeowTillery/issues/45 "Issue 45")
* Including Weapons in the inventory that can be equipped. [Issue 49](https://github.com/Jazny/MeowTillery/issues/49 "Issue 49")
* Character Movement on Speech or a talking animation. [Issue 15](https://github.com/Jazny/MeowTillery/issues/15 "Issue 15")
* Character Interaction which is pretty Vague. [Issue 13](https://github.com/Jazny/MeowTillery/issues/13 "Issue 13")
* Which I took as Dialogue and inventory management which is ongoing.
* This is picking things up in general. [Issue 62](https://github.com/Jazny/MeowTillery/issues/62 "Issue 62"

# What did I not get to?
* I didn't finish the ambient human AI which does some very interesting activity.
* Character Interaction isn't complete as dialogue and inventory management aren't complete.
* There is no talking animation; I didn't know how to do that. I also did not have time to learn how to draw custom sprites in this timeframe.
* The Hotbar is essentially just the background for one at the moment, and it needs a lot more work.
* Equipment slots have not been implemented yet.

# Problems Encountered
* Inventory needs the hud, and it needs the main node to be called world. Requires some renaming in files.
* There is no animation for speech.
* Ambient human AI currently acts in a very primitive way with it mostly bumping into walls.
* Technically possible to try to pick up anything except it will crash the game if it isn't an item.

# What was accomplished?
A suprising amount considering the limited time constraints that I had. I had a lot of additional work to do in other classes and multiple tests which really constrained from where I planned to end this sprint at to where I have ended up at. I still have done a decent amount of work, but not nearly as much as I was hoping to or planning to. I still commited a fair deal of work, but I can't help but feel a bit disappointed with the results at the end. My systems do work, and they are even mostly bug-free. However, I can't shake the feeling that I could have done much more if my schedule permitted it. Cest la vie, but it leaves me with plenty to work on with Sprint 4.
