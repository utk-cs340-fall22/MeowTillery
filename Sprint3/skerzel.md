Sprint 3

Sean Kerzel, skerzel, Meowtillary

Planned: 
- Work on a sanity replenishing system in the safe rooms
- Work on means of getting back health when eating/sleeping 
- Fix whitening main charactrer bug

Did not do: 
- I didn't give Squango real means of attacking, when testing how to damage the enemy I just made Squango to contact damage to the enemy as a placeholder

Problems: 
- Getting means to damage enemy (just to test the enemy health system more efficiently) 
- The enemy kept walking off screen (group mate fixed this, just not on the version I was working on)
