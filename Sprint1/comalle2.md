#Sprint 1#
My name is Conor O'Malley. My Github ID is comalle. The prject that I am working with is called MeowTillery.

#Planned to do#
*I was assigned to issue #4 : [Named Link](https://github.com/Jazny/Meowtillary/issues/4 "Issue 4")
*The issue is fairly vague, so I set out to provide the basic Dialogue functionality.
*Adding a textbox.  [Named Link](https://github.com/Jazny/Meowtillary/issues/17 "Issue 17")
*Attaching said textbox to a specific character. [Named Link](https://github.com/Jazny/Meowtillary/issues/16 "Issue 16")
*Adding a proximity trigger for dialogue. [Named Link](https://github.com/Jazny/Meowtillary/issues/18 "Issue 18")

#What did I not get to?#
*Dialogue Proximity or you have to be close to someone to talk to them.

#Problems Encountered#
*Dialogue doesn't repeat in the demo version.
*Proximity is not a factor with the dialogue currently.
*Due to being very new to game development, seemingly simple tasks needed a lot of online tutorials to bring me  up to speed.

#Issues I worked on#
*I was assigned to issue #4 : [Named Link](https://github.com/Jazny/Meowtillary/issues/4 "Issue 4") 
*This is the only issue I worked on and only one assigned to me, and it was a fairly complex one which is why I broke it down into seperate issues.
*Adding a textbox.  [Named Link](https://github.com/Jazny/Meowtillary/issues/17 "Issue 17")
*Attaching said textbox to a specific character. [Named Link](https://github.com/Jazny/Meowtillary/issues/16 "Issue 16")
*Adding a proximity trigger for dialogue. [Named Link](https://github.com/Jazny/Meowtillary/issues/18 "Issue 18")

#Files I worked on#
*Dialogue/DialogBox.gd
*Dialogue/Test_Dialogue.gd

#What was accomplished?#

I think I achieved a fair bit to be honest. I created the basics of a dialogue system for a language that I really did not understand that well.
I still have a long way to go with my abilities in this department since I still could not manage to add a functional proximity for the dialogue itself.
What I did add was a textbox, animations for said textbox, a textbox attached to a specific character, the text box does display text, and 
a proximity trigger for players for them to show which NPC has dialogue. This is a major deal for any game is to have functional dialogue, so I am decently 
proud of what I have accomplished in such a short amount of time on such an unfamilar system.
