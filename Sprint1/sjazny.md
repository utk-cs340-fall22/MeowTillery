#What I planned to do
I planned to create the rubric and foundation of our group's platformer game. On my side, this included:
- programming a finite state machine for character movement
- programming a loading screen protocol upon launch
- creating and importing original character sprites

#What I did not do
I planned to have NPC's in the game by this point. This would include:
- NPC interaction/dialogue
- Interactive NPC movement and scene changes

#What problems have I encountered
Rustiness with the GD script slowed me down and temporarily dampened our full potential a little in the beginning. However, the new familiarity everyone has with GD script will elevate everyone's productivity in the next sprint.

#Issues I worked on
2: Left & Right Movement
7: Loading Screen
9 & 10: Sprite Animation Upload
14: Title Screen Graphic

#What I accomplished
I accomplished a lot of things I did not have full confidence in entering this project. Firstly, I learned an unfamiliar script with teammates that were slightly less familiar than me. I managed to use this script to integrate commands, such as the key-binds and how they are coded into events in the game/ scene. I also managed to upload original animated sprites and bind them to appropriate movements (.play(), just pressed(), is_pressed(), etc.).
