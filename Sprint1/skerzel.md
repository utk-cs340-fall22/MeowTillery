Sprint 1
========

Sean Kerzel, skerzel, Meowtillary

Planned: - Create the tilesets - Make a rigid-body floor that has a
collision body with the main character - Make a layed background that
the character doesn't collide with

Did not do: - I did not add any other rigid body objects in the
environment to avoid (flat ground)

Problems: - Mainly learning godot and how to create a tile map - When
working with individual sectioned tiles, finding a way to blend the
edges together

Meowtillary/background\_testing.tscn

Finished: - Create the tilesets - Make a rigid-body floor that has a
collision body with the main character - Make a layed background that
the character doesn't collide with - Coded some effects for the startup
scene
