## What I planned to do
For Sprint 2, we drastically changed the style of work for our group. We each worked modularly on large components of the project and tried to make them all as self-sufficient as possible. My main three tasks included programming a menu screen, doorways to change scenes upon play entrance/ exit, and an NPC 'AI.'

## What I did not do
I did all tasks specified this sprint. The option button in the menu, however, will need a scene to route to. This will most likely be an issue for the upcoming Sprint.

## Problems I encountered
NPC "AI" comes at different degrees of complexity. Something that I did not think about before I began programming Cat1.gd (Cat1.tscn's AI) is that a every single point of intellegents must be coded into a system. For example, something as simple as which direction an NPC is "facing" has to be part of it's finite state machine for reference of which direction it is going (-x or x). Then, the NPC had to have a range of sight which dictates how far it can be and still detect a player (needed for hdialogue and hostiles). It was challenging to work on all those basic aspects and then build on them.
