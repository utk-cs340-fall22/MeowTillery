# Sprint 2
- Name: Jack Arndt
- username: jackarndt
- group: MeowTillery

### What I planned to do
- Fix audio bug
- Implement basic enemy code
- Start work on a basic health system

### What I did not do
- Contribute to the health system, the enemy's movement and hit detection proved to be complicated

### Problems encountered
- Upon merge, we have a damage system incompatibility which we have hotfixed.
- I have a potential bug that the AI may move towards any other character, not necessarily the main character, but I have an idea for a potential fix
- attack is currently unavoidable, need to add a short delay

### Issues worked on
