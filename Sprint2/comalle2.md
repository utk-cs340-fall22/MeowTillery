# Sprint 2
My name is Conor O'Malley. My Github ID is comalle. The prject that I am working with is called MeowTillery.

# Planned to do
* I was assigned to issue 36: [Issue 36](https://github.com/Jazny/MeowTillery/issues/36 "Issue 36")
* This issue was essentially a basic inventory with stacking and some other features.
* Adding an ambient Human AI.  [Issue 35](https://github.com/Jazny/MeowTillery/issues/35 "Issue 35")
* Adding dialogue for an ambient human character. [Issue 34](https://github.com/Jazny/MeowTillery/issues/34 "Issue 34")
* First Introduction character, essentially replacing Mr. Godot's sprite. [Issue 21](https://github.com/Jazny/MeowTillery/issues/21 "Issue 21")
* Character Movement on Speech or a talking animation. [Issue 15](https://github.com/Jazny/MeowTillery/issues/15 "Issue 15")
* Character Interaction which is pretty Vague. [Issue 13](https://github.com/Jazny/MeowTillery/issues/13 "Issue 13")
* Which I took as Dialogue and inventory management.

# What did I not get to?
* I didn't finish the ambient human AI which does some very interesting activity.
* Character Interaction isn't complete as dialogue and inventory management aren't complete.
* There is no talking animation, I didn't know how to do that.

# Problems Encountered
* The character can't access the inventory yet, and the placeholder just has randomly generated items in it.
* There is no animation for speech. 
* Ambient human AI currently acts in a very bizarre way which isn't indicative of how normal human's function.

# What was accomplished?

Last Time, I thought I did a lot. I did a lot more than last time. I think the Dialogue system by itself was like 93 lines of code compared to the forty eight that I did last time. Plus, my code works better than last time, excluding the CAFE_NPC1.gd script which is very buggy. The inventory system is very basic at the moment as you can basically just move things in the inventory and add things to stack up on each other. It isn't accesible to the player, but I wasn't aimning for that this sprint. I just was wanting to get some basic functionality of it going. The first introduction character was just changing the sprite from the Godot icon into a custom sprite which was easy enough. You could technicallly count the character animation while talking to be the idle animation that I implemented, but that wouldn't make sense as it just plays in a loop constantly. So, I didn't feel like it was really fair to count that.
