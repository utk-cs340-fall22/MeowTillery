Background
----------

Video games have quickly grown to become the largest entertainment
industry in the world. Cats are the most numerous pet amongst US
households. By combining these together in the form of an action-packed,
cat-themed, 2 dimensional adventure game, there is a vast quantity of
potential customers. Simple, retro stylized, graphics have grown to be
extremely appealing to consumers in recent years, and the constant
admiration for cats, especially as displayed on the internet, would
garner a large interest from consumers. Not many games combine the
enjoyment of taking care of pets and the fun of fighting dangerous foes.
So, Meowtillery would stand out as being a uniquw and worthwhile
experience.

Project Overview
----------------

MeowTillery is a fast-paced 2D action game. This game utilizes a wide
variety of enemies including bosses all with interesting designs. This
game relies on a dual management and action gameplay loop. This loop
revolves around balancing out your ability to make money and level up
cats to facilitate further upgrades to your defenses. However, you can
also raise your cats themselves to become fearsome weapons. These
weapons are each unique to each cat, and can be cultivated via
increasing their level. However, losing out on high levelled cats will
cause you to lose money and potentially increase defenses. This unique
balancing act keeps players engaged and motivated to keep going through
this gameplay loop. Now, this is all occurring behind the backdrop of an
engaging story which focuses on the journey of Squango, an unfortunate
outcast and misfit, who earns the Cat Cafe via a brutal life and death
struggle. Now, having gotten the Cafe, Squango will face all new
challenges from within his new community as many new members won't
accept him as a member. Thus, Squango must brutally carve a path through
his many enemies and various opponents to finally become truly free to
be a part of the community and to make it as a cat cafe owner.
