# What was accomplished?
I would say a fair amount more than I could expect. I implemented a functional hotbar and scrolling mechanic, and I completed practically all of my remaining issues. Only one of my issues was basically defacto completed by just chanigng plans and change of creative focus. However, I added a whopping 581 lines of code to the project all in all, and it took a fair amount of time to make sure that it is all working properly. I think I really learned a lot about how these sorts of projects operate. Now, other than that, I also added equipment slots including weapons slots. I was able to have all of these sytems interact with the current inventory system, and I created a spawning system for some of these items to be utilized in a demo. Likewise, I modified the HUD to further allow the hotbar to have designated keys for each slot plus having the holding_item be defined there for all of my inventory functions. The ItemData includes stats and descriptions for all weapons to be used in the respective weapons programs.
