What was accomplished?
======================

I was able to implement quite a few additions. I was able to implement
the tutorial cafe owner enemy, who will simply pursue the player and
attack with a short range melee attack. I was able to then implement two
projectile based weapons for the player to be able to use. One of these
weapons, the "ACat-47" allows for single shot projectiles, while the
other, the "Meowchine Gun" will shoot a rapid stream of projectiles. I
also implemented the animations for these two weapons, plus the
animations for the two melee weapons. I was not able to implement the
save and load system as I originally planned, just due to it being too
late in development to begin the complex process of doing so, since
other necessary features are still being finished.
