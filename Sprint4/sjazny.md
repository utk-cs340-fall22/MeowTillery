## Files I worked on
I worked on many files this sprint, but the four major ones are:

intro_quip.gd

cats_global.gd

caged_grey_cat.gd

caged_creme_cat.gd

## What I accomplished
We have an intro quip to the game now that introduces the main storyline instead of leaving the player guessing. We also have global variables that keep track of child nodes in the game. Therefore, progress can be measured and saved in global data.
