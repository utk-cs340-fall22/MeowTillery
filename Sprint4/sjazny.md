## Files I worked on
I worked on many files this sprint, but the four major ones are:

intro_quip.gd

cats_global.gd

caged_grey_cat.gd

caged_creme_cat.gd

## What I accomplished
We have an intro quip to the game now that introduces the main storyline instead of leaving the player guessing. We also have global variables that keep track of child nodes in the game. Therefore, progress can be measured and saved in global data. This makes the game a little heavier since every global variable must be loaded in any scene of the game, but it makes the experience more robust and continuous, rather than single-objectived. Along with this, I linked the intro scene to play right from the starting menu and made each frame skipable depending on user preference.
