## Description

MeowTillery is a 2D pixel RPG created with GD-Script with C# and C++ integrations. As an RPG, the character's movement is controlled by player input and player interaction with the environment. Physical keybinds are used to control player input. You (the player) play as Squango, a curious and inventive person with a questionable moral-compass. You go through an intro quip that has a short synopsis of Squango's life and the story events that brought you to the first playable scene. You are able to feed and- eventually- weaponize the cats in a cat cafe. The weapons unlock different damage levels and different waves of enemies. The enemies (hostile NPCs) of the world are from a strange organization called "PITA," and are adament about closing down your cat bio-engineered artillery.

As the player, your main objective is to keep your bio-engineering of the cats into weapons uninturrupted by fighting off the waves. Throughout, you may notice the ambient NPC interactions and diologue that will give you hints of the exposition.
